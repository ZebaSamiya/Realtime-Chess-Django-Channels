# Realtime-Chess-Django-Channels

This repository contains two projects that implement a full-stack, multiplayer chess game using Django. The first version uses AJAX polling to update game state, while the enhanced version incorporates real-time communication using WebSockets and Django Channels. Both projects use server-side rendering (SSR) and are deployed to Google Cloud Platform (GCP).
