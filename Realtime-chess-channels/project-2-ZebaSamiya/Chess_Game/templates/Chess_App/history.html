      <p>Chess is a game with a long and rich history, its invention credited to ancient northern India around the 6th century. Its early form had been called "chaturanga," which literally means "four divisions of the military": infantry, cavalry, elephants, and chariots, the predecessors of modern pawn, knight, bishop, and rook, respectively. Chaturanga spread from India to Persia, where the game became known as "shatranj." It enjoyed its wide popularity within the Persian Empire and then moved on into the Arab world.</p>
  
      <p>The game continued to evolve and took more standardized forms as it migrated to Europe during the Middle Ages. In the 15th century, chess had taken a modern form in Spain and Italy. The principal changes included making the queen the most powerful piece on the board, while changing the movement of other pieces such as bishop and pawn. These changes made the game faster and more exciting.</p>
  
      <p>By the 19th century, chess developed into an international activity, with the first official World Chess Championship being held in 1886, marking the beginning of organized chess in its modern form. As the years went by, the game spread to all corners, and grandmasters acquired names for their amazing skills and unprecedented analytical insight. Nowadays, chess is enjoyed by millions of people all over the world, both over the board and online, and is considered one of the greatest strategy games ever invented.</p>
